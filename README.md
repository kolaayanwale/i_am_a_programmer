# i_am_a_programmer
This is where everything I learn in my programming journey can be found and I can teach others.
## Bio
I graduated as a mechanical engineer, and decided software engineer suited me better. So I wrote my first 'Hello World' line of code in HTML as you do. 
Fast forwarding 18 months and now I work as a DevOps engineer. I want to build out my GitHub repo as a single source of truth for everything I learn (well, as much as I remember to note, which should be everything!) for a reference for me and also to answer questions from fellow programmers.
