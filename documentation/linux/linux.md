### Error: Built in node had no space on the /tmp directory to run a Jenkins job
### Solution: Resize the /tmp directory to be greater than 1GB
* Since /tmp is tmpfs, itâ€™s using RAM, not disk.
* You resize it by remounting with a larger size (mount -o remount,size=2G /tmp).
* To make it permanent, update /etc/fstab.
* wait a few minutes to reconnect after rebooting
```
df -h /tmp
sudo mount -o remount,size=2G /tmp
sudo nano /etc/fstab
#new line if missing -> tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,size=2G 0 0
sudo reboot
```

### Error: sudo required a password from jenkins
### Solution: allow jenkins user to run sudo without requiring a password
* Figure out which user is running Jenkins. usually jenkins
```
ps -ef | grep jenkins
```
* modify visudo
```
sudo visudo
```
* Add: jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dnf
