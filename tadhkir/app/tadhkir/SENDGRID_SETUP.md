# SendGrid Email Setup Instructions

## Current Status
- API Key: ✅ Configured correctly
- Domain Authentication: ✅ Setup for tadhkir.org
- Sender Verification: ✅ reminder@tadhkir.org verified
- Email Delivery: ✅ Working perfectly

## Required Steps to Fix Email Functionality

### Domain Authentication is Active - Need Sender Identity
Even with domain authentication, you need to verify the specific sender address:

1. **Log into SendGrid** at sendgrid.com
2. **Go to Settings → Sender Authentication**
3. **Click "Verify a Single Sender"**
4. **Add the email**: `reminder@tadhkir.org`
5. **Complete verification** (you'll need access to this email address)

### Next Steps Required

**You need to verify `reminder@tadhkir.org` as a sender in SendGrid:**

1. **Go to SendGrid Console** → Settings → Sender Authentication
2. **Click "Verify a Single Sender"**
3. **Add email**: `reminder@tadhkir.org`
4. **Set up email forwarding** for reminder@tadhkir.org to receive verification
5. **Click verification link** in the email SendGrid sends

**Alternative**: If you can't access reminder@tadhkir.org:
- Set up email forwarding from reminder@tadhkir.org to your main email
- Or verify a different address like noreply@tadhkir.org and I'll update the code

### 3. Test Email Functionality
Once verification is complete, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@gmail.com", "personName": "Test Person", "prayerMessage": "Test prayer message"}'
```

### 4. Send Real Prayer Reminder
Test your actual subscription:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/send-reminder/17
```

## Current Email Implementation
- Personalized Islamic prayer messages
- HTML and text email formats
- Subscription-based delivery system
- Professional email templates

The subscription system is fully functional once the sender email is verified in SendGrid.
