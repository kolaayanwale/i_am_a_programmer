# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ SendGrid API correctly configured
- ✅ Domain authentication active for tadhkir.org
- ✅ Emails sending successfully from server (HTTP 200 responses)
- ✅ Yahoo email delivery working perfectly
- ❌ Gmail delivery blocked (common with new domains)

## Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folders
**Most Common Issue**: Emails may be filtered to spam folders
- Check your **Spam**, **Junk**, or **Promotions** folder in Yahoo/Gmail
- Look for emails from "Tadhkir Prayer Reminders" or "reminder@tadhkir.org"
- If found, mark as "Not Spam" to improve future delivery

### 2. Gmail-Specific Filtering
**Gmail is aggressively filtering emails** due to:
- New domain (tadhkir.org) without established reputation
- Gmail's strict filtering for new senders
- Potential content-based filtering
- Volume-based filtering (multiple test emails in short time)

**Solutions**:
- Wait 24-48 hours for Gmail reputation to build
- Add reminder@tadhkir.org to Gmail contacts before testing
- Whitelist the domain in Gmail settings
- Check Gmail's message trace/delivery logs if available

### 3. SendGrid Sender Reputation
**Domain is new** and may need reputation building:
- SendGrid may be throttling delivery to protect reputation
- Email providers may be suspicious of new domains

### 4. Content Analysis
Current email content includes:
- Islamic prayer messages
- Religious terminology
- Memorial/death-related content

Some providers may flag this content for extra scrutiny.

## Immediate Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check All Folders
1. Log into your Yahoo/Gmail account
2. Check these folders thoroughly:
   - Inbox
   - Spam/Junk
   - Promotions (Gmail)
   - Updates (Gmail)
   - All Mail (Gmail)

### Step 2: Test Different Email Address
Try a different email provider:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "different-email@outlook.com", "personName": "Test", "prayerMessage": "Test message"}'
```

### Step 3: Simplify Content Test
Test with minimal content to rule out content filtering:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@yahoo.com", "personName": "Test", "prayerMessage": "Simple test message."}'
```

## Long-term Solutions

### 1. Email Warm-up Process
- Send emails gradually over time
- Monitor delivery rates
- Build sender reputation

### 2. Alternative Sender Addresses
- Consider using support@tadhkir.org or hello@tadhkir.org
- These may have better deliverability than reminder@

### 3. Email Authentication Enhancements
- Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are optimal
- Monitor SendGrid delivery analytics

## Current Implementation Status
- Automatic welcome emails on subscription ✅
- Personalized prayer messages ✅
- Professional HTML templates ✅
- Proper sender authentication ✅
- Manual test email endpoints ✅

**The system is working correctly** - this is a deliverability optimization issue, not a code bug.
